# Vial
Vial is a spectral warping wavetable synthesizer. The source must flow.

This is a fork of the mtytel/vital repository. Modifications here are minimal and are mostly aimed at making the project a bit more vanilla and suitable for local development. My particular focus is on getting my own build that will run natively on my Mac M1. I'll also try to update this readme with general build instructions as I have time.

## What can you do with the source
The source code is licensed under the GPLv3. If you download the source or create builds you must comply with that license.
