# Vial is a spectral warping wavetable synthesizer
## About
This is a fork of the mtytel/vital repository. Modifications here are minimal and are mostly aimed at making the project a bit more vanilla and suitable for local development. 

The early focus is on getting my own build that will run natively on my Mac M1. The build prosses for the standalone app and the AU plugin work well without much work but building the VST is a bit tricky as you currently need the VST2 API and it can't be distributed. I'll try to update this readme with general build instructions as I have time.
